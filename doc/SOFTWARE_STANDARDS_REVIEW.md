# Software Standards Audit: `SData` Statistical Data Interpreter

**Date:** 2026-06-08 (§3 revised 2026-06-09) | **Version:** 0.9.6 (§3 reflects 0.9.7 fixes) | **Auditor:** /software-standards v1.1.1
**Repository:** `/home/jries/Develop/sdata` (+ path-pinned `~/Develop/sdata-core`)
**Stack:** Ada 2012, GNAT/GPRbuild, Alire, SQLite3, Zip-Ada, XML-Ada, MathPaqs
**Domain:** Single-process batch/interactive interpreter — tabular statistical data processing
**Scope:** All Ada source in both crates (`sdata`, `sdata-core`), build system, test suite, packaging, docs
**Mode:** Adversarial single

*First re-audit since the three-crate split (v0.8.0, ADRs 039–043). The previous
clean rewrite (v0.6.14, 2026-05-14) is preserved in git history. Where the split
materially changed a dimension, the delta and its driver are called out.*

---

## 1. Architectural Integrity — **76/100**

### 1.1 The Three-Crate Split (ADRs 039–043)

Since v0.8.0 the project is three siblings under `~/Develop`: **sdata** (lexer,
AST, parser, interpreter, sdata-only commands), **sdata-core** (table + SQLite
spill, Variables/PDV, evaluator, Values, file I/O, shared `Execute_*` commands,
config, signals, system — consumed via an Alire path pin), and **data-vandal**
(sister app reusing sdata-core). The boundary is **acyclic**: sdata imports ~11
sdata-core packages; sdata-core imports nothing from sdata. ADR-040 keeps lexer/
AST/parser out of sdata-core, so each app owns its own surface syntax.

The split is well-motivated and cleanly bounded, but it imposes real integrity
costs that a single-crate design did not have:

- **Façade indirection.** Every shared command now routes through a
  `SData_Core.Commands.Execute_*` procedure (e.g. `execute_declarative.adb:86` →
  `Execute_USE` → `File_IO`). Correct, but a layer the v0.6.14 code lacked.
- **Capacity-constant duplication.** `src/sdata.ads:13–18` and
  `~/Develop/sdata-core/src/sdata_core.ads` define the *same* `Max_Name_Len`,
  `Max_Path_Len`, etc. with no cross-reference — a DRY violation that can silently
  diverge.
- **SELECT round-trip.** Because the evaluator lives in sdata-core but the parser
  does not, `SELECT expr` is re-serialised to text and re-parsed via
  `Evaluator.Parse_Expression`. Negligible at typical script sizes, but a real
  indirection introduced by ADR-040.

### 1.2 Execution Model — intact

The three-tier model (declarative / immediate / deferred, `sdata-interpreter.adb`
dispatch) is unchanged and still strictly enforced; deferred statements are queued
at parse time and run once per record. No tier leakage.

### 1.3 Module Decomposition

| File | Lines | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `src/parser/sdata-parser.adb` | 2,554 | largest; recursive-descent, unchanged shape |
| `src/sdata-help.adb` | 1,594 | table of literals, not complexity |
| `src/sdata-interpreter.adb` | 1,205 | dispatch + data step |
| `sdata-core/.../sdata_core-table.adb` | 1,174 | column store + SQLite spill |
| `sdata-core/.../sdata_core-evaluator.adb` | 1,059 | expression eval (bounded recursion, exempted) |
| `src/sdata-interpreter-execute_declarative.adb` | 828 | grew from 299: now single+multi USE, multi-target SAVE, options |

`sdata_core-commands.adb` (711 lines) is a new, coherent home for the shared
`Execute_*` procedures. No file inverts its dependencies; nothing is orphaned.

### 1.4 Concerns

- Cross-crate change coordination (see §4.2) is the dominant integrity tax.
- `execute_declarative.adb` at 828 lines is approaching the point where its merge-mode arms should become named subprograms (see §2).

**Δ from v0.6.14 (78):** −2. The split is sound engineering, but façade
indirection, duplicated capacity constants, and the SELECT round-trip are net
integrity costs not offset within this dimension.

---

## 2. Code Quality & Craftsmanship — **80/100**

### 2.1 Language Use

Ada 2012 idiom is exploited correctly: discriminated records for `Value`
(`sdata_core-values.ads:18–29`) and the AST `Statement` (`sdata-ast.ads`),
exhaustive `case` analysis, named association at call sites
(`execute_declarative.adb:86–97`), `Ada.Containers` for the statement list and
symbol tables, and `Limited_Controlled` `Finalize` for the SQLite backing store.

### 2.2 DRY — improved in v0.9.6

The float→integer truncation rule, previously inlined in two places, is now
centralized in `SData_Core.Values.Convert_Value` (`sdata_core-values.adb:23–48`);
`Table.Coerce_Value` delegates to it (`sdata_core-table.adb:267,272`). This is a
concrete craftsmanship gain (ADR-044).

### 2.3 Naming, Comments, TODOs

Identifiers are self-documenting (`Flush_PDV_To_Output`, `Rebuild_Column_Cache`,
`Convert_Value`). **Zero** `TODO`/`FIXME`/`XXX` across both crates. The one dated
deferral (`sdata_core-table.adb:96`, a bounded SQLite-handle leak gated on an
`ada_sqlite3` bump) is explicit and conditional. No commented-out code.

### 2.4 Concerns

- **`execute_declarative.adb` Execute_Declarative** is an 828-line procedure with
  nested per-merge-mode case arms (MM_Single / Positional / Match / Interleave /
  Join / Append) plus SAVE/OPTIONS. It is the one place cognitive load is high;
  its arms should be extracted into named subprograms.
- **No enforced static analysis.** `gnatcheck.rules` exists (two rules) but is not
  run in CI (Ubuntu `asis-programs` only). CodePeer unused. Pragma-`Annotate`
  exemptions for the bounded evaluator recursion are justified.

**Δ from v0.6.14 (82):** −2. The DRY win and clean naming are offset by the
oversized declarative-dispatch procedure and still-absent enforced SAST.

## 3. Efficiency & Performance — **83/100**

> **Post-audit correction (v0.9.7, 2026-06-09).** This audit (v0.9.6) scored the
> data-step hot path as "O(1), no per-row hashing — a highlight." That was wrong:
> a real-world script later exposed **three latent O(n²) defects** in the data
> step, two of them in the supposedly-clean hot path. All three are now fixed
> (sdata PR #21 / commit `396048a`, sdata-core PR #29 / commit `99a7534`,
> v0.9.7 / sdata-core 0.1.7). The score is revised **up** because the hot path is
> now genuinely linear; the prose below is corrected to match.

### 3.1 Hot Path & Storage

The in-memory column store spills to SQLite at `Max_Table_Cells` via batched
transactions (`Spill_Table_To_Disk`), with a segment cache on read and
`journal_mode=OFF`/`synchronous=OFF` for throughput — a genuine highlight.

Column access via `Column_Cursor_Cache` is O(1). **However, the per-record output
flush was not.** `SData_Core.Variables.Flush_PDV_To_Output` called
`Get_Column_Type`, which did `Column_Maps.Element (Cursor).Typ` — returning the
whole `Column` *by value*, deep-copying its entire `Value_Vectors` data (every
row) just to read one enum. Called per-column-per-record, this made **every**
`RUN` O(rows²): a plain `use; run` over 32k rows took ~402s. **[RESOLVED v0.9.7,
commit `99a7534`]** — read `Typ` through `Constant_Reference` (O(1)); the same
case now runs ~1.3s.

### 3.2 Transient-table build — was O(rows²)

`Transient_Table.Add_Row` / `Set_Value` copied the whole column vector on every
call (copy-modify-copy-back), so any transient build — `/append` and merge
(`sdata-merge.adb`), `Snapshot_From_Current` / `Install_To_Current`, and the
single-`USE`/`SAVE` option projection — was O(rows²). A 49k-row `/append` took
~791s. **[RESOLVED v0.9.7, commit `396048a`]** — mutate in place via `Reference`;
the merge now runs ~9s. This also makes the single-`USE`-with-options
snapshot/install O(rows) rather than O(rows²), retiring the prior cycle's "honest
debit" for that feature.

### 3.3 BY re-sort per record — was O(rows²·log rows)

A `BY` statement inside a data-step body is dispatched once per record, and each
dispatch re-sorted the entire table. **[RESOLVED v0.9.7, commit `396048a`]** — an
idempotent guard skips the re-sort when the requested BY keys already match the
established ones (the input table is immutable during the step and the sort is
stable); bare `BY` still cancels grouping.

### 3.4 Remaining

- `Transient_Table.Get_Value`/`Set_Value` still do a per-cell linear column-index
  scan + `To_Upper` (O(cols) per cell); minor at typical widths, a candidate for a
  cached position map.
- Parser heap-allocates AST nodes; no arena. Fine below ~1,000 statements.
- No per-statement profiling or memory-usage reporting infrastructure.

**Δ from v0.6.14 (78):** +5. The three O(n²) defects that were latent at audit
time are fixed; the hot path, transient build, and BY step are now linear, with
the strong spill design intact. The audit's failure to catch these on inspection
is itself a finding (see Hard Truth).

---

## 4. Maintainability & Evolvability — **80/100**

### 4.1 Test Coverage

| Suite | Count |
|---|---|
| Integration `.cmd` | **196** |
| `csv_unit_test` | 71 |
| `sdata_unit_test` (Table/Variables/PDV/transient/merge) | 355 |
| `evaluator_unit_test` | 170 |
| `file_io_unit_test` | 89 |
| `interpreter_unit_test` | 48 |
| **Unit total** | **733** |

CI runs all unit suites + 196 integration tests + a fuzz-corpus regression on push
and PR. data-vandal carries its own 44 integration tests (run manually / its own CI).

**Gap (carried from v0.6.14):** `sdata_core-statistics.adb` (775 lines, ~54
distribution/IDF/RNG functions) still has **no dedicated unit tests** — exercised
only indirectly via integration scripts. Boundary conditions, monotonicity, and
IDF∘CDF round-trips are unverified at the unit level.

### 4.2 Change Resilience

Adding a *deferred statement* is still a clean single-crate change (AST + lexer +
parser + one interpreter subunit). Adding/altering a *shared command*, however, is
now a **two-crate** change: edit `SData_Core.Commands`, rebuild sdata-core, bump
its version + the consumer constraint, rebuild sdata. ADR-044 is a real example
(touched both crates + `alire.toml`s). The path pin and CI sibling-checkout make
this manageable, but the friction is real and worth acknowledging in process docs.

### 4.3 Decision Records — excellent

44 ADRs (ADR-001…044), 22 design specs, 28 implementation plans. ADRs 039–043
document the split rationale/boundary/consequences in depth; ADR-044 covers the
RENAME suffix-type rule. `scripts/bump-version.sh` updates 9 files atomically.

**Δ from v0.6.14 (84):** −4. Strong docs and growing tests, but the untested
statistics module and the two-crate change burden are genuine evolvability costs.

---

## 5. Error Handling & Resilience — **73/100**

### 5.1 Strategy

`Script_Error` carries descriptive context and is caught at the top level in
`sdata_main.adb`; `--continue-on-error` resumes per-statement with `ERR()`/`ERL()`.
`--ignore-math-errors` maps FP domain errors to `Val_Missing`. SQLite failures are
wrapped with operation context at five sites in `sdata_core-table.adb`
(e.g. `:505–512`). CSV emits actionable, non-fatal warnings (filename/row/column)
rather than silently coercing. `Limited_Controlled` `Finalize` + SIGINT/SIGTERM
handlers (`sdata_core-signals.adb`) remove the SQLite temp file on every catchable
exit path.

### 5.2 `when others` inventory

44 total (sdata 20, sdata-core 24); ~10 are silent `=> null`. Spot-checked, the
silent ones are legitimate (AST-walk "other kinds" branches, exhaustive-case
catch-alls with `pragma Warnings`, non-fatal index-resolution). The two the prior
audit flagged in the interpreter body remain the weakest pattern but are bounded.

### 5.3 Gaps

- **`Conversion_Error` / `Type_Mismatch_Error` are uncaught.** In current paths
  they are effectively unreachable — `Apply_Rename`'s pre-validation rejects the
  numeric↔character crossing before `Convert_Value` runs, and `Coerce_Value` only
  invokes `Convert_Value` for numeric↔integer — so they would only ever surface via
  the top-level `when others`. Defensive, but they should be wrapped into
  `Script_Error` at the sdata-core boundary for clean messaging.
- **No SUBMIT nesting-depth limit** (loop detection exists; depth does not).
- **No per-expression timeout** (a non-terminating `WHILE` runs forever).

**Δ from v0.6.14 (73):** 0. Net flat — SQLite/CSV/signal handling remain strong;
the new exceptions add a minor surfacing gap offset by thorough RENAME validation.

---

## 6. Security Posture — **76/100**

### 6.1 Trust Model & Controls — intact

The OS account is the boundary (as `awk`/`make`/`R system()`). Controls:
`--noshell`, `--nosubmit`, root/SYSTEM auto-enforcement
(`sdata_core-system.adb`), per-command shell timeout, and `Sql_Id`
bracket-escaping of column names at every DDL site in `sdata_core-table.adb`. No
hardcoded secrets.

### 6.2 Gaps

- **Threat model — REFRESHED 2026-06-09 (remediation #1, done).**
  `doc/threat_model.md` was stamped v0.6.13 / 2026-05-14 / "Current" and predated
  the three-crate split, merge/transient machinery, multi-target SAVE, and RENAME
  type conversion. It is now updated to v0.9.7: new attack-surface rows
  (merge/transient, per-dataset/target options), T1 extended to RENAME-derived
  names (covered by `Sql_Id`), a new **D4** (merge `/JOIN` amplification +
  unbounded transient memory, since transient tables don't spill), corrected file
  references, and refreshed gaps/deployment guidance.
- **Fuzz corpus did not grow with the code.** Drivers still cover CSV/parser/ODS/
  XLSX; the ~886-line merge path and RENAME syntax have no fuzz driver. The CI job
  is seed-corpus regression, not coverage-guided fuzzing. (Now also logged as a
  gap in the threat model.) **This is the remaining §6 debit.**
- No SAST in CI (gnatcheck Ubuntu-only; CodePeer unused).

**Δ from v0.6.14 (77):** −1. The threat-model staleness that drove the prior −3 is
resolved; the still-missing merge/RENAME fuzz coverage keeps it just below the
v0.6.14 mark.

---

## 7. Operational Readiness — **72/100**

### 7.1 Improvements

- **Packaging version derivation is robust.** The bundled sdata-core version is
  *derived*, never hardcoded: the Makefile injects it from `../sdata-core/alire.toml`
  for the SRPM; `debian/rules` and `slackware/sdata.SlackBuild` glob the bundled
  `sdata-core-*` tree. This closes a whole class of drift.
- **CI breadth.** `.github/workflows/test.yml` checks out sdata-core as a sibling
  (path-pin aware), builds, runs `make check` + fuzz-corpus. sdata-core additionally
  has a consumer-tests workflow that runs sdata against it.
- **Observability.** `--debug[=N]` three levels, runtime `OPTIONS DEBUG N`,
  `ERR()`/`ERL()`, and the BREAK/WHEN inspector.

### 7.2 Gaps

- **No progress reporting** (`--progress`/record-count) for long USE/SORT/aggregate
  runs — silence until completion.
- **No unified ecosystem CI:** data-vandal is not exercised in sdata's pipeline
  (manual `cd ~/Develop/data-vandal && make check` per CLAUDE.md). The sdata-core
  consumer-test pin also lags the current sdata release.
- Stale in-repo test counts (see §8) cause onboarding confusion.

**Δ from v0.6.14 (66):** +6. Derived-version packaging, expanded CI, and richer
debug/test infrastructure are concrete operational gains — the one dimension that
improved.

---

## 8. Documentation — **85/100**

### 8.1 Current & strong

- **Man page** (`man/man1/sdata.1`, 1,098 lines, stamped v0.9.6 / 2026-06-06):
  covers merge modes, multi-target SAVE with `IF=`, and RENAME type-suffix
  conversion.
- **ADRs** (44), **specs** (22), **plans** (28) — a thorough, current design trail
  including ADR-044 and the rename spec/plan dated this cycle.
- **`doc/architecture.md`** updated for the three-crate package map.
- README/CONTRIBUTING cover the path-pin model and multi-platform packaging.

### 8.2 Gaps

- ~~**Stale test counts.**~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-06-09** (remediation #2): `CLAUDE.md`
  and `CONTRIBUTING.md` now state 197 integration tests / ~733 unit checks / 44
  data-vandal tests, with `make check` named as the source of truth. (One stale
  pair remains in the *sdata-core* `CLAUDE.md` — separate repo, PR pending.)
- ~~**Threat model stamp stale** (§6)~~ — **resolved 2026-06-09** (refreshed to v0.9.7).
- **`doc/design.odt` remains binary-only.** A `design.txt` exists locally but is
  **untracked** (not committed), so the authoritative spec is still ODF-only in git.
- Statistics module has citations but no prose on implementation-choice rationale.

**Δ from v0.6.14 (87):** −2 → **85** (2026-06-09). The two documentation-currency
failures (stale threat-model stamp, stale test counts) are both now fixed; the
remaining debits — `design.odt` committed binary-only (the `design.txt` is
untracked) and the statistics module's missing implementation-choice prose — are
smaller and keep it just shy of the v0.6.14 mark.

---

## Overall Scores

Scores are as of v0.9.6 except three revised post-audit: **Efficiency** (→83
after the three O(n²) fixes in v0.9.7, §3), **Security** (→76 after the
threat-model refresh, §6), and **Documentation** (→85 after the threat-model and
test-count syncs, §8) — all 2026-06-09. The total returns to the v0.6.14 mark,
but the *composition* differs: Efficiency and Operational Readiness up, the split-
and-currency dimensions down.

---

## The Hard Truth

The code is not what slipped — the *discipline around it* is. SData v0.9.6 is a
well-built interpreter with an enviable test count, a clean acyclic crate split,
and a man page that actually matches the binary. Yet the headline number went
**down**, and that is the honest signal: the three-crate split bought reuse at the
price of coordination friction nobody has paid down, the statistics module is
still 775 lines of numerical approximation with **zero** unit tests guarding it,
and the threat model is a document describing a program that no longer exists —
stamped "Current" while two releases of new attack surface (merge, transient
tables, RENAME type coercion) went unanalysed. And this audit's own §3 illustrates
the trap: it read the data-step hot path, pronounced it "O(1) — a highlight," and
**missed three latent O(n²) defects** that made a routine 49k-row script take
thirteen minutes. They were caught not by inspection but by a profiler on a real
workload — proof that "looks linear" is not the same as "is linear," and that
this codebase needs a standing performance test on a non-trivial dataset, not just
correctness tests. (All three are now fixed in v0.9.7, and a
standing perf-regression test — `tests/perf_regression.cmd`, which fails the
suite if any path goes quadratic again — now guards them; §3 is revised up
accordingly.) None of the remaining items are emergencies. All of them are the
kind of debt that is invisible right up until SData 1.0 puts a stability promise on
top of it. Fix the threat model and the statistics tests before that promise, not
after.
